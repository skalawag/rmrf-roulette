* Description
This script enables you to play Russian Roulette with your file
system. If you ``win,'' it will execute the command

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    rm -rvf --no-preserve-root /
  #+END_SRC

This is for real. You will watch your file system disappear. It is
quite fun, actually, if you can convince someone to play with you!

* How to use it.

Download the script onto the machines that will participate, change
=debug= to =False=, and run it as you would run any python script. You
will be prompted for some information, and asked to confirm whether
you really want to do it.

Then take turns against your opponent or opponents.
